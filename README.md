# [CSV to HTML](https://marcnitzsche.de/csv-to-html)

This is a quick solution to convert a CSV to an HTML page.

## How

After a CSV file is selected this app will render a page with all fields under their respective header.

## Motivation

I conducted a survey on [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) to find a flatmate and now have responses from 50+ people that I need to process (and they are quite long!) I could obviously use the Typeform interface to go through all of them â€“ but I thought it would be a much better experience to read them on my Kindle. This tool converts the CSV file to a HTML which I'll pass to [DotePub](https://dotepub.com/) (it sadly does a poor job) for conversion to `.epub`. I then edit the resulting file in [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/), convert it to `.mobi` or `.awz3` and copy it to the Kindle.

# CSV to HTML

This is a quick solution to convert a CSV to HTML page.

## How

Drop or select a CSV file and this app will render a page with all fields.

## Motivation

I conducted a survey on [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) to find a flatmate and have now responses of 50+ people that I need to process (and they are quite long!). I could obviously use their interface to go through all of them â€“ but I thought it would be a much better experience to read them on my Kindle. This tool converts the CSV file to a HTML which I can send to my Kindle using [SendtoReader](https://sendtoreader.com/)
